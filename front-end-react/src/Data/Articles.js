        paragraphs: [
            "The qualification round is an shorter, individual start, sprint competition where it is all about to individually run a sprint course and have the top 12 best running time in your heat. All athletes are allocated to three different parallel heats, each with an estimated winning time of 8-10 minutes. The best 12 in each qualification heat qualify for the Quarter finals. All 36 qualifiers are divided into 6 quarter finals with 6 athletes in each quarterfinal. It is in the quarter finals that the Knock-Out starts and it is first to finish that matters. 6 athletes stand on the start line in each heat and start at the same time. The first 3 to finish in each heat qualify for the semi finals. In semi finals there are 3 heats with 6 athletes on each one. The two first to finish in each heat qualify for the final. The last race is one and only final with 6 athletes. First to finish wins the competition. Placings are determined by the sequence of crossing the finish line. Because of it’s short duration and mass start, speed to decide the finishing order and agility to move through terrain in an effective manner, are qualities which play a bigger role in knock-out sprint than in other orienteering distances. That and intense orienteering where even the smallest differences can be decisive, makes for an exciting entertainment. So, who are the best at this new format of orienteering? Basically, the same orienteers who have already shown great capacity at “classic” sprint orienteering - Swiss and Swedish orienteers can usually be counted among the absolute favourites.",

            "Easter prize, which on 2021 will take place for the 19th consecutive year, has always been competition which closely follows tendencies of international sprint orienteering. Sprint orienteering was something new in 2002, when first Easter prize took place and since then competition format, map and course standards have been changed according to what the best Latvian orienteers will face in international championships. So it seems only logical to introduce knock-out or elimination sprint format, which already has been tested in World Cup events and will be one of the courses in future World and European championships.",

At first the feeling was that knock-out format is too much for us to handle, but other members of the team convinced me that we can do it,\" says main organiser Jānis Tamužs.",
